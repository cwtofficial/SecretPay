---

## ✨ Features

### Core Functionality

- **Password-Protected Transfers:** Lock ETH behind a secret password
- **Claim Mechanism:** Recipients unlock funds with the correct password
- **Automatic Refunds:** Senders can withdraw if unclaimed after deadline
- **Multiple Transfers:** Support for unlimited concurrent transfers
- **Event Tracking:** All actions emit events for off-chain monitoring

### Security Features

- **Hashed Passwords:** Uses `keccak256` for secure password storage
- **Access Control:** Only authorized parties can execute specific functions
- **Re-entrancy Protection:** Follows checks-effects-interactions pattern
- **Time Locks:** Deadline-based refund mechanism

---

## 💡 Use Cases

### 1. **Crypto Gifts with Riddles** 🎁

Send ETH with a riddle as the password. Perfect for birthdays, holidays, or special occasions.

**Example:**

```
Password: "What has keys but no locks, space but no room?"
Answer: "keyboard"
```

### 2. **Freelance Escrow** 💼

Lock payment until project completion. The password acts as the delivery confirmation.

**Flow:**

1. Client creates transfer with agreed password
2. Freelancer completes work, receives password
3. Freelancer claims payment

### 3. **Educational Rewards** 🎓

Teachers can reward students who solve challenges correctly.

**Example:**

```
Challenge: "Calculate 15% of 280"
Password: "42"
```

### 4. **Gaming Treasure Hunts** 🎮

Hide crypto rewards in games where players discover passwords through gameplay.

**Example:**

```
Quest: Complete dungeon level 5
Reward: 0.1 ETH locked with password found at end of level
```

## 🔧 Smart Contract Overview

### Main Functions

#### `createTransfer(address _recipient, string memory _password, uint256 _deadline)`

Creates a new password-protected transfer.

**Parameters:**

- `_recipient`: Address that can claim the funds
- `_password`: Secret password (will be hashed)
- `_deadline`: Duration in seconds before refund is possible

**Requirements:**

- Must send ETH (value > 0)
- Password cannot be empty
- Deadline must be in the future

**Example:**

```javascript
// Create transfer: 0.1 ETH, password "secret123", 7 days deadline
createTransfer(
  '0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb',
  'secret123',
  604800, // 7 days in seconds
);
```

#### `claimTransfer(uint256 _transferId, string memory _password)`

Claim funds by providing correct password.

**Parameters:**

- `_transferId`: ID of the transfer to claim
- `_password`: Password to unlock funds

**Requirements:**

- Must be the recipient
- Password must match
- Deadline not yet passed
- Transfer not already claimed

**Example:**

```javascript
claimTransfer(0, 'secret123');
```

#### `refundTransfer(uint256 _transferId)`

Refund unclaimed transfer after deadline.

**Parameters:**

- `_transferId`: ID of the transfer to refund

**Requirements:**

- Must be the sender
- Deadline must have passed
- Transfer not already claimed

**Example:**

```javascript
refundTransfer(0);
```

### Events

```solidity
event TransferCreated(
    uint256 indexed transferId,
    address indexed sender,
    address indexed recipient,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 deadline
);

event TransferClaimed(
    uint256 indexed transferId,
    address indexed recipient,
    uint256 amount
);

event TransferRefunded(
    uint256 indexed transferId,
    address indexed sender,
    uint256 amount
);
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### ✅ Implemented Security Features

1. **Password Hashing**

   - Never stores plain text passwords
   - Uses `keccak256` for one-way hashing
   - Resistant to rainbow table attacks

2. **Re-entrancy Protection**

   - Follows checks-effects-interactions pattern
   - Updates state before external calls
   - No known re-entrancy vulnerabilities

3. **Access Control**
   - Only recipient can claim
   - Only sender can refund
   - Time-based restrictions enforced

### ⚠️ Important Warnings

1. **Passwords are NOT Private**

   ```
   ⚠️ Anyone can see the password hash on-chain
   ⚠️ If someone knows possible passwords, they can brute force
   ⚠️ Don't use this for high-value transfers in production
   ```

2. **Block Timestamp Manipulation**

   ```
   ⚠️ Miners can manipulate timestamps by ~15 seconds
   ⚠️ Don't rely on exact deadline precision
   ⚠️ Use block numbers for critical timing
   ```

3. **Gas Limitations**
   ```
   ⚠️ `transfer()` has 2300 gas limit
   ⚠️ May fail with smart contract recipients
   ⚠️ Consider using `call()` for production
   ```

### Production Improvements

For production use, consider:

- **Commit-Reveal Scheme:** Two-step password submission
- **Multi-Signature:** Require multiple parties to approve
- **Upgradeable Contracts:** Use proxy patterns for bug fixes
- **Professional Audit:** Get code reviewed by security experts
- **Emergency Pause:** Add circuit breaker functionality

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing in Remix

```solidity
// Test Scenario 1: Successful Transfer & Claim
1. Deploy contract with Account A
2. Create transfer to Account B (0.1 ETH, password: "test123")
3. Switch to Account B
4. Claim transfer with password "test123"
5. Verify Account B received ETH

// Test Scenario 2: Wrong Password
1. Create transfer to Account C (0.1 ETH, password: "secret")
2. Switch to Account C
3. Try claiming with wrong password "wrong"
4. Verify transaction reverts

// Test Scenario 3: Refund After Deadline
1. Create transfer with 60 second deadline
2. Wait 60 seconds
3. Call refund as sender
4. Verify sender received ETH back
```

---

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Transaction Reverted"

**Cause:** Not sending enough ETH with `createTransfer()`

**Solution:**

```javascript
// In Remix, set "Value" field before calling function
// In ethers.js:
await contract.createTransfer(recipient, password, deadline, {
  value: ethers.utils.parseEther('0.1'),
});
```

### Issue 2: "Incorrect Password"

**Cause:** Password case sensitivity or extra spaces

**Solution:**

```javascript
// Passwords are case-sensitive!
"Secret123" ≠ "secret123"

// Trim spaces
password.trim()
```

### Issue 3: "Deadline Not Passed"

**Cause:** Trying to refund before deadline

**Solution:**

```javascript
// Check current time
const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
const deadline = await contract.transfers(0).deadline;
console.log(`Wait ${deadline - now} more seconds`);
```

### Issue 4: "Not the Recipient"

**Cause:** Wrong account trying to claim

**Solution:**

```javascript
// Switch MetaMask account to recipient address
// Or in Remix, select correct account from dropdown
```
